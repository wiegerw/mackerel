/// \brief Components for generating an arbitrary element of a sort
///
/// A representative is an arbitrary element of a given sort. This
/// component takes a specification and generates representatives for sorts
/// defined by the specification. An important property is that for the
/// same sort the same representative is returned. For this it assumes
/// that the context -constructors and mappings for the sort- remain
/// unchanged.
///
/// The general aim is to keep the representative expression as simple. Use of
/// constructors is preferred above mappings and constructors or
/// mappings representing constants are preferred over those that have
/// non-empty domain.
///
/// Constructors and functions that have arrows in their target sorts
/// (e.g. f:A->(B->C)) are not used to construct default terms. Once an
/// element is generated it is kept for later requests, which is done for
/// performance when used frequently on the same specification. At some
/// point a sufficiently advanced enumerator may be used to replace the
/// current implementation.
///
/// This component will evolve through time, in the sense that more
/// complex expressions will be generated over time to act as
/// representative a certain sort, for instance containing function symbols
/// with complex target sorts, containing explicit function constructors
/// (lambda's). So, no reliance is possible on the particular shape of the
/// terms that are generated.
